## Workflow: AI-Powered Foodie Tour Generator

This workflow was built using Julep’s no-code AI platform to generate a rich, narrative-based one-day culinary itinerary for any city. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how the workflow functions:

### 1. User Input: City Name
- The user provides the name of a city.
- This serves as the main input for all subsequent data lookups and narrative generation.

### 2. Weather Retrieval & Dining Suggestion
- The agent fetches real-time weather data for the specified city.
- Based on the weather (e.g., sunny, rainy, humid), it suggests whether to prefer indoor or outdoor dining.
- This influences the narrative tone and restaurant atmosphere.

### 3. Selection of Iconic Local Dishes
The agent selects three iconic local dishes representing:
- **Breakfast**
- **Lunch**
- **Dinner**

These are chosen based on the city’s culinary culture and relevance to locals and tourists.

### 4. Restaurant Discovery
For each selected dish, the agent identifies a top-rated or culturally popular restaurant or food stall in the city that serves it.  
Selection is influenced by:
- Local reputation  
- Landmark proximity  
- Historical or street-food relevance  

### 5. Narrative Generation
For each meal, the agent crafts a rich, story-driven narrative that includes:
- Description of the dish  
- Cultural context  
- Atmosphere of the dining location  
- Suggested time and mood of the experience  

### 6. Culinary Day Summary
- The final output includes a closing narrative that ties the entire day together.
- This provides a sense of journey and emotional connection to the city's food culture.

### 7. Output Formatting
- The entire output is structured in a readable format with clear sections for:
  - Breakfast  
  - Lunch  
  - Dinner  
  - Narrative Summary  
- Designed to be engaging, informative, and ready for use in travel or recommendation applications.
